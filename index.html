								<p>NEVADA – Data from the Kids Count Data Center shows the country’s highest average of families that lost a source of income was found in Nevada with an average of 36.3%. Hawaii was a close second with an average of 34.1%, although
									<a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/HI,NV/PST045219">their population is just nearly half of Nevada’s</a>.
									<br>
								<p> “For some of these families, supports like unemployment assistance are not going to cover the income that they lost when they lost their job,” said Gabrielle Pepin, a microeconomist at the Upjohn Institute whose work focuses on
									how
									public programs affect families with children.
									<br>
								<p>The pandemic has brought nearly every state to <a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R46554.pdf">“unemployment rates greater than their highest unemployment rates during the Great Recession.”</a>
									<br>
								<p>Studies have shown that family income during childhood <a href-"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/697477">affects a child’s long-term outcomes</a>, such as educational attainment, employment, health, crime history,
									and
									earnings. “To what extent do we want to help families?” said Pepin. “There might be consequences the longer term as these children grow up.”
